NOTES:

- h1 is occasionally different. Some pages use "Rensselaer's", while others use "Rensselaer".
- tabs highlights are frequently incorrect. They use the classes "tabon", "taboff", "bgtabon", "bgtaboff" to highlight.
- Anything that isn't the main menu has a hyperlink to go back (could do without? after all there's a tab that takes you there...)
- Code is practically the same until you reach "END OF twbkwbis.P_OpenDoc"
- Occasionally, there are footer links. This isn't true for all pages, and the links differ between pages. However, looks like they're mostly the same per tab.
